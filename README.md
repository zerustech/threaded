# ZerusTech Threaded Component
The *ZerusTech Threaded Component* is a library that provides some commonly used
thread-safe classes, such as piped input stream and piped output stream.

Thanks to the krakjoe/pthreads extension, it's eventually possible to
develop multi-threaded applications in php-cli.
